#A valid e-mail adress is required to access the IP database. [Ex. spigot@gmail.com]
#If you do not change this value, you might be banned from the database.
email: "insert@email.here"

#What should the plugin do to players who join with a VPN? (kick OR none)
#Kick: Kicks the player every time they join with a VPN.
#None: Do nothing. You can use /avpn check <player> to see if the player is using a VPN-connection.
punishment: "kick"

#Enable logging? Every time a player (tries to) join(s) the server with a VPN-connection, it will be logged to log.txt. [true/false]
log: true

#Messages

#Plugin prefix (Prefix displayed before every message)
prefix: "&c&lAnti&8&lVPN&c&l>>"

#Kick message (Message displayed when a player gets kicked for joining the server with a VPN)
kickmessage: "&7* &cKikado. Desligue sua VPN para conectar-se ao servidor!"

#Permanent ban message (Message displayed when a player gets banned for joining the server with a VPN)
banmessage: "&4Você está permanentemente banido desse servidor por se juntar a uma conexão VPN."

#Notification message ("antivpn.mod") 
notificationmessage: "&4Jogador &c%player% &4tentou juntar-se a uma conexão VPN."

#Should players with "antivpn.mod" receive a message when a player (tries to) join(s) the server with a VPN-connection? [true/false]
notification: true

#IP-whitelist: Add any IP-addresses to this list and they won't be blocked by AntiVPN. (Example below)
whitelist:
    - 123.456.78.90
    
#Probability: Number from 1-100. The lower this number, the faster it will think an IP is a VPN-connection.
#Example: IP 123.456.78.90 has 20% chance of being a VPN, but the probability is set to 90%, it won't think the IP is a VPN-connection.
#If the probability is set to 10%, it will think the IP is a VPN and it will block it.
#It is not recommended going under 95%, as it will increase the chance of false kicking someone for a VPN.
percent: 98


#Enable flood protection? This will kick any player that tries to join the server when the query limit is reached.
#Players will be able to join again when the query limit is reset. (Default: 15 queries/minute) [true/false]
#Setting this to false will let any player join the server when the query limit is reached (even players with VPNs).
#Setting this to true will kick any player that tries to join the server when the query limit is reached (even players WITHOUT VPNs).
#False is recommended on big servers, otherwise a lot of players will have to wait 1 minute before joining again.
floodprotection: false
floodmessage: "&eA proteção anti-inundação AntiVPN está ativa. Junte-se novamente em 1 minuto."

#Enable downtime protection? This will kick any player that tries to join the server when the database returns an error.
#This could be: Scheduled maintenance, an attack, or the daily query limit is reached (500 queries/day).
#This is NOT recommended to set to true.
downprotection: false
downmessage: "&eA proteção AntiVPN está ativo. Tente novamente em breve."

#Enable caching? Caching will save the IP and probability temporary so if a player joins with the same IP, it doesn't need to make a request
#to the database again, which saves you a query. It is recommended that you leave this on.
#Specify a time in HOURS a value will be cached. It is NOT recommended caching a particular value for more than 6 hours.
#The Internet drastically changes over a short period of time. Hijacked networks pop up and go away relatively quickly. 
#A low scoring IP's behavior can change in a matter of seconds, as well as a high scoring IP.
#All cached values will be cleared when the plugin/server reloads or restarts.
caching:
  enabled: true
  time: 4
    
#Enable debug? This will output stacktraces and more to the console. [true/false]
debug: false

#Subdomain that is used to check players on getipintel.net. (ONLY CHANGE WHEN YOU PURCHASED EXTRA QUERIES BY CONTACTING THE DEVELOPER OF GETIPINTEL.NET)
#Default: check
#Example: abcd.getipintel.net -> "abcd"  -- Fill in the part before '.getipintel.net' when you purchased more queries at getipintel.net
#Changing this to an invalid value will completely break this plugin.
subdomain: "check"
